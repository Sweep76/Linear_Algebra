Therefore, the variables x, y, and z are combined linearly with constant coefficients; no square roots, trigonometric functions, or other nonlinear operations are used. <br><br>\n",

    "<li> $ x^{-1}+7y+z = \\sin{(\\frac{\\pi}{2})} $\n",
    "    <br> - Since variables should always be raised to the first power, the above equation is non-linear because variable x is raised to the power of -1. The function of $x (x^{-1})$, which is not a constant, determines the coefficient of x. Although $\\sin{(\\frac{\\pi}{2})}$ is a linear constant, it still isnt able to make the equation a whole linear equation. <br><br>\n",
    "<li> $ x^1+y^1+z^1=0 $\n",
    "    <br> - The equation is clearly a linear equation. The first thing to notice is that all three variables (x, y, and z) have an exponent of 1, which is a feature of linear equations. Second, these variables are simply combined together with coefficients of 1, as there are no multiplicative terms influencing them. Third, the variables are not subjected to any further nonlinear processes, such as square roots or trigonometric functions. Last but not least, we have a constant, which is 0 on the right side. The right-hand side of a linear equation is always a constant value.\n",
